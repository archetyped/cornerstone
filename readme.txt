Enhanced content management for Wordpress

== Description ==
Cornerstone makes WordPress practical for **any type of site** by enhancing its content management capabilities.  Too long have we had to resort to hacks like using categories in menus to build a pseudo site structure (you know what I'm talking about).

Cornerstone enhances your WordPress site in several ways.  One of the most useful features is one that allows Wordpress to be used for sites that go beyond just blogging-- **Posts in Sections**.  Create a section, add posts to it, they show up when visitors navigate to that section.  Simple as that.  It really is, but because you're awesome [here's a tutorial on how to do it](http://archetyped.com/know/how-to-organize-posts-in-sections-in-wordpress-with-cornerstone/).

### Thanks for the Support!
